# ML-learning
> Samples of some ML algorithms and visualisations

## Efficent Apriori and FP-Growth - Frequent itemset mining algorithms

- prepocessing data;
- creating frequent itemset and rules;
- visualising Efficent Apriori rules with PyARMViz library;
- visualize and output FP-tree with Graphviz;
- testing the running time of the algorithms.

## KNN, SVM, RF algorithms + visualising with t-SNE and UMAP

- prepocessing data;
- normalizing data with StandardScaler;
- balancing train data with SMOTE;
- GridSearch hyperparameters and comparing results;
- visualising models with t-SNE and UMAP;
- checking CatBoost algorithm with the same data;
- looking feature importance (FI) with CatBoost and SHAP.
