> Samples of some ML algorithms and visualisations

## Efficent Apriori and FP-Growth - Frequent itemset mining algorithms

- prepocessing data;
- creating frequent itemset and rules;
- visualising Efficent Apriori rules with PyARMViz library;
- visualize and output FP-tree with Graphviz;
- testing the running time of the algorithms.
